Techniques of representing information in semi-formal languages such as Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and free text are compared. The issues associated with representation and extraction of information encapsulated in textual and visual formats, such as the semantic unit perceived as an event, will be explored. Examples of text and visual modelling techniques such as probabilistic and vector models will be used to illustrate AI applications."

This paper covers fundamental and advanced aspects of language (especially text) and vision from an artificial intelligence perspective. The primary focus is on practical algorithms, tools and systems of text, vision intelligence, as well as their performance evaluation. Techniques of representing information in semi-formal languages such as Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and free text are compared. The issues associated with representation and extraction of information encapsulated in textual and visual formats, such as the semantic unit perceived as an event, will be explored. Examples of text and visual modelling techniques such as probabilistic and vector models will be used to illustrate AI applications."

This paper covers fundamental and advanced aspects of language (especially text) and vision from an artificial intelligence perspective. The primary focus is on practical algorithms, tools and systems of text, vision intelligence, as well as their performance evaluation. Techniques of representing information in semi-formal languages such as Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and free text are compared. The issues associated with representation and extraction of information encapsulated in textual and visual formats, such as the semantic unit perceived as an event, will be explored. Examples of text and visual modelling techniques such as probabilistic and vector models will be used to illustrate AI applications."

   "prescriptor": "Aotearoa/New Zealand�s colonial past has had a significant influence on the criminal justice system and even contemporary criminal justice policy regarding policing and imprisonment is influenced by trends in the international community. In both the past and present the policies derived from Western notions of criminal justice has negatively impacted Maori. Therefore, it is important to have a critical understanding of the methods of social control used in New Zealand and numerous other jurisdictions. Using comparative criminology as an approach to critically analyse policing and incarceration in the context of different jurisdictions, provides an opportunity for greater understanding of how colonising practices and the other biases in the criminal justice system impact negatively on society. Furthermore, the advantages and pitfalls of transferring policies from one country to another are critically examined through the lens of colonisation and globalisation."

Longstanding views of children as victims and/or threats will be balanced against contemporary views of children as rights-bearing individuals. Students will investigate the degree to which New Zealand�s current criminal justice system respects children�s rights, whether that child is an offender, a complainant, or a bystander witness."

The steady shift to technology-rich, flexible educational environments disguises certain assumptions that require critical attention. Similarly, the associated promotion of de-privatised practice and student-led pedagogical approaches related to these developments raise significant questions about teaching and learning. This paper supports educational practitioners as they develop a more attuned understanding of how spatiality influences learning. Course participants will develop their knowledge and understanding of the design of flexible environments and the practices these innovative spaces enable through both collaborative and autonomous study. Comprehending and critically responding to the relationship between pedagogy and space requires a knowledge of the elements of effective design and how these can be evaluated for their pedagogical value."

Therefore, it is important to have a critical understanding of the methods of social control used in New Zealand and numerous other jurisdictions. Using comparative criminology as an approach to critically analyse policing and incarceration in the context of different jurisdictions, provides an opportunity for greater understanding of how colonising practices and the other biases in the criminal justice system impact negatively on society. Furthermore, the advantages and pitfalls of transferring policies from one country to another are critically examined through the lens of colonisation and globalisation."
